# Title

## Simple Summary

“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.” Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the Mailchain Improvement Proposal.

## Abstract

Short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation (*optional)

The motivation is critical for MIPs that want to change the Mailchain protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the MIP solves. MIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification

Technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Mailchain platforms.

## Rationale

Flesh out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Guide-level explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in mailchain and you were explaining it to another mailchain user or developer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how mailchain users should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use mailchain. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample messages, transaction data, or request/response messages.

For implementation-oriented RFCs (e.g. for compiler internals), this section should focus on how compiler contributors should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy RFCs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms.

## Reference-level explanation

This is the technical portion of the design. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Unresolved questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the design process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this design that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this design?

## Backwards Compatibility

All MIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The MIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. MIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases

Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for MIPs that are affecting specification changes. Other MIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.
